# Audio Communication System Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates an audio communication system in MATLAB, covering the entire transmission process from audio signal generation to evaluation. It showcases various signal processing, modulation, and denoising techniques.

## Modules

The project consists of five main modules:

1. **audiogen**: Generates synthetic audio signals.
2. **process**: Resamples and quantizes the audio signals.
3. **transmitter**: Simulates transmission, including noise addition.
4. **receiver**: Demodulates the received signal and removes noise.
5. **evaluator**: Evaluates the quality of the received audio and calculates metrics.

## GitHub Repository

## Usage

1. Run the `audiogen` module to generate a synthetic audio signal.
2. Process the generated signal using the `process` module for resampling and quantization.
3. Transmit the processed signal with noise addition using the `transmitter` module.
4. Demodulate the received signal and remove noise in the `receiver` module.
5. Evaluate the quality of the received signal in the `evaluator` module.
